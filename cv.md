# About me
My name is Islam and I am 17 years old. I was born in Podstepnoye, in West Kazakhstan, and now I study at Narxoz University in Almaty. This year, I finished my first year of study and in the future, I want to become a software developer. RS School will help me with that. My dream is to create my own startup and make a difference in our country.

# Skills
* Java

  # Code example:
```java
public class Task1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = makeNegative(1);
        System.out.println(a); // should print -1
        a = makeNegative(-5);
        System.out.println(a); // should print -5
        a = makeNegative(0);
        System.out.println(a); // should print 0
    }

    public static int makeNegative(final int x) {
        if (x > 0) {
            return -x;
        } else {
            return x;
        }
    }
}
